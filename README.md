# generator-verb [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/generator-verb.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/generator-verb)  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/assemble/generator-verb.png)](https://travis-ci.org/assemble/generator-verb)

> Kickstart documentation for any project! This is the official Yeoman generator for Verb, a zero-configuration markdown documentation generator that is extremely easy to use and extend.

Once installed globally, simply run:

* `yo verb` to to start a new project
* `yo verb boilerplate:[foo]` to use a [specific boilerplate](https://github.com/assemble/verb-boilerplates). Verb boilerplates are just sets of documents.
* `yo verb doc:[foo]` to add a [specific document](https://github.com/assemble/verb-readme-includes) or 'include'.

## Getting Started
If you don't already have [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) installed, you must first run the following to be this generator:

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

Once Yeoman is installed, to install generator-verb from [npm](npmjs.org), run:

```
$ npm install -g generator-verb
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```
$ yo generator-verb
```

### Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He's a person with feelings and opinions, but he's very easy to work with. If you think he's too opinionated, he can be easily convinced.

If you'd like to get to know Yeoman better and meet some of his friends, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io), check out the complete [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started).

## Options
Command: `--skip-install`

Skips the automatic execution of `bower` and `npm` after scaffolding has finished.
