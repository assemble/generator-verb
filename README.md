# generator-verb [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/generator-verb.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/generator-verb)

> Kickstart documentation for any project! This is the official Yeoman generator for Verb, a zero-configuration markdown documentation generator that is extremely easy to use and extend.

Once installed globally, simply run:

* `yo verb` to to start a new project
* `yo verb:boilerplate [foo]` to use a [specific boilerplate](https://github.com/assemble/verb-boilerplates). Verb boilerplates are just sets of documents.
* `yo verb:doc [foo]` to add a [specific document](https://github.com/assemble/verb-readme-includes) or 'include'.

## Getting Started
If you don't already have [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) installed, you must first run the following to be this generator:

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

Once Yeoman is installed, to install generator-verb from [npm](npmjs.org), run:

```
$ npm install -g generator-verb
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```
$ yo verb
```

### Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He's a person with feelings and opinions, but he's very easy to work with. If you think he's too opinionated, he can be easily convinced.

If you'd like to get to know Yeoman better and meet some of his friends, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io), check out the complete [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started).

## Usage
Running the generator with `yo verb` will add the following files to your project:

* `docs/README.tmpl.md`: a readme template
* `.verbrc.yml`: a runtime config file for Verb
* `package.json`: with minimal properties defined. However, if this exists already `verb` will be added to `devDependencies`.

### Sub-generators

You can add specific documents to your project by running:

```
yo verb:doc foo.md
```

Where `foo` is the name of the file you want to add. If the name used matches an actual file in [verb-readme-includes](https://github.com/assemble/verb-readme-includes), then that file will be copied into the `docs/` directory of your project.

If the name _doesn't match_ a valid file in [verb-readme-includes](https://github.com/assemble/verb-readme-includes), then a new "starter" document will be created using the given file name.

## CLI Options
Command: `-s` | `--skip-install`

Skips the automatic execution of `bower` and `npm` after scaffolding has finished.

Command: `-w` | `--skip-welcome-message`

Skips the Yeoman welcome message.
